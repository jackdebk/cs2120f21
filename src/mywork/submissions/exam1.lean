Explain the inference (introduction and
elimination) rules of predicate logic as
directed below. To give you guidance on
how to answer these questions we include
answers for some questions.
-/


-- -------------------------------------

/- #1: → implies [5 points]

INTRODUCTION

Explain the introduction rule for →. 

[We give you the answer here.]

In English: Given propositions, P and Q, 
a derivation (computation) a proof of Q 
from any proof of P, is a proof of P → Q.

In constructive logic, a derivation is a
given as a function definition. A proof
of P → Q literally is a function, that,
when given any proof of P as an argument
returns a proof of Q. If you define such
a function, you have proved P → Q.

ELIMINATION

Complete the definition of the elimination
rule for →.


(P Q : Prop) (p2q : P → Q) (p : P)
----------------------------------
     (q : Q)

-- Give a formal proof of the following
example : ∀ (P Q : Prop) (p2q : P → Q) (p : P), Q :=
begin
  assume P Q,
  assume p2q : P → Q,

end

INTRODUCTION

Give the introduction rule for true using
inference rule notation.

[Here's our answer.]

---------- intro
(pf: true)

Give a brief English language explanation of
the introduction rule for true.

-- answer here

ELIMINATION

Give an English language description of the
eliimination rule for true.

[Our answer]

A proof of true carries no information so
there's no use for an elimination rule.
-/

-- Give a formal proof of the following:

example : true :=
begin
  exact true.intro,
end


-- -------------------------------------

/- #3: ∧ - and [10 points]

INTRODUCTION

Using inference rule notation, give the 
introduction rule for ∧.

[Our answer]

(P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q)
---------------------------- intro
        (pq : P ∧ Q)

Given an English language description of
this inference rule. What does it really
say, in plain simple English. 

If we have two propositions, P and Q and a proof of
P and a proof of Q, then we have a proof that both
P and Q are true.

ELIMINATION

Given the elimination rules for ∧ in both
inference rule and English language forms.
-/

/-
(P Q: Prop) (pq : P ∧ Q)
------------------------ left elimination
      (p : P)

(P Q: Prop) (pq : P ∧ Q)
------------------------ right elimination
      (p : Q)

Left elimination
If we have two propositions, P and Q, and a proof that both
P and Q are true, then we have a proof of P.
Right elimination
If we have two propositions, P and Q, and a proof that both
P and Q are true, then we have a proof of Q.
-/

/-
Formally state and prove the theorem that, 
for any propositions P and Q,  Q ∧ P → P. 
-/

example : ∀ (P Q : Prop), Q ∧ P → P :=
begin
  assume P Q,
  assume qandp : Q ∧ P,
  exact and.elim_right qandp,
end

-- -------------------------------------

/- #4: ∀ - for all [10 points]

INTRODUCTION

Explain in English the introduction rule for ∀. If 
T is any type (such as nat) and Q is any proposition 
(often in the form of a predicate on values of the
given type), how do you prove ∀ (t : T), Q? What is
the introduction rule for ∀?

/-
If we assume an arbitrary object t of type T, then prove
that Q is true for t, then Q is true for all objects of
type T.
-/

ELIMINATION

Here's an inference rule representation of the elim
rule for ∀. First, complete the inference rule by
filling in the bottom half, then Explain in English
what it says.

(T : Type) (Q : Prop), (pf : ∀ (t : T), Q) (t : T)
-------------------------------------------------- elim
                (q : Q)

/-
If we have a type T and a proposition Q, and if Q is true
for all objects of type T, then if we have an object t of type
T, we have a proof of Q.
-/

Given a proof, (pf : ∀ (t : T), Q), and a value, (t : T),
briefly explain in English how you *use* pf to derive a
proof of Q.

context of these assumptions, given answers to the

  -- (1) Lynn is a person
  -- (2) Lynn knows logic
  (Lynn : Person)

Now, formally state and prove the proposition that
Lynn is a better computer scientist

/- #5: ¬ - not [10 points] 

The ¬ connective in Lean is short for *not*. Give
the short formal definition of ¬ in Lean. Note that
surround the place where you give your answer with
a namespace. This is just to avoid conflicting with
Lean's definition of not.

Explain precisely in English the "proof strategy"
of "proof by negation." Explain how one uses this
strategy to prove a proposition, ¬P.

To prove a proposition by negation, one assumes the opposite
of the proposition, then prove that there is a contradiction
given that assumption, or that the

Explain precisely in English the "proof strategy"
of "proof by contradiction." Explain how one uses
this strategy to prove a proposition, P (notice 
the lack of a ¬ in front of the P). 

Fill in the blanks the following partial answer:

To prove P, assume ¬P and show that ¬P → false.
From this derivation you can conclude ¬¬P.
Then you apply the rule of negation elimination
to that result to arrive a a proof of P. We have
seen that the inference rule you apply in the 
last step is not constructively valid but that it
is classically valid, and that accepting the axiom
of the excluded middle suffices to establish negation
elimination (better called double negation elimination)
as a theorem.

ELIMINATION 

As with ∧, ↔ has two elimination rules. You can 
see their statements here.

#check @iff.elim_left

Formally state and prove the theorem that 
biimplication, ↔, is *commutative*. Note: 
put parentheses around each ↔ proposition,
as → has higher precedence than ↔. Recall
that iff has both elim_left and elim_right
rules, just like ∧.

each expression means.

Equality can be understood as a binary relation
on objects of a given type. There is a binary 
equality relation on natural numbers, rational 
numbers, on strings, on Booleans, and so forth.

We also saw that from the two axioms (inference
rules) for equality, we could prove that it is
not only reflexive, but also both symmetric and
transitive.

Complete the following definitions to express
the propositions that equality is respectively
symmetric and transitive. (Don't worry about
proving these propositions. We just want you
to write them formally, to show that you what
the terms means.)

def eq_is_symmetric : Prop :=
  ∀ (T : Type) (x y : T), x = y → y = x
